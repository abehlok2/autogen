Search the web for information about how to optimize prompts that are to be fed into an LLM to generate a desired result. When you have determined the important qualities, considerations, best practices, and techniques for writing prompts, prepare for a second task. Briefly sum up your thoughts as you progress, but use minimal text. 

The second task will be to generate a prompt or "System Message". A "System Message" is a prompt that is provided to the LLM that is from neither the user nor the AI. It essentially acts as a preparatory statement that better prepares the model for the user interaction so that they can guide the output to more closely align with their desired end-result. 

You will generate this prompt or system message based on two things: 
1. The user's request, designated between curly braces as such: {Request}
2. Utilize the information you've gathered concerning optimal prompt crafting to create the highest quality prompt possible for the user. 

The user may provide additional details alongside their request. Take these into account as well. 

The third task will be to iteratively critique improve this prompt in the following manner: 

**Prompt 1**
-critique, do more research
-revise, create prompt 2 
**Prompt 2** 
-critique, do more research, adding to optimization knowledge base.
-revise Prompt 2, create Prompt 3 
**Prompt 3**
-critique...

So on and so forth. Minimum 2 iterations. Maximum 10 iterations.
